####<br>There are two stages, the first one is easy, for getting used to the controls.<br>
You get to the second level when you defeat all enemies.<br>
The second one is more difficult, since the reappeared enemies shoot and move faster.<br>
The change of the background picture also increases the difficulty.<br>
You have three lives but due to state of being still in development, it gets refreshed if you manage to reach the second stage.<br>
If you defeat the five enemies on the second stage, you have beaten the game.<br>

#####State<br>
It is still in developing state, so some features are instable:<br>
The "Start"-announcement appear sometime too fast.<br>
stepping up to stage 2 does not always work;<br>
some dots disappear even though they hit nothing;<br>
