###Written with JS and tested out on Chrome.


####There are only two stages, the first one is easy, for getting used to the controls.
You get to the second level when you defeat all dogs and cats.
The second one is more difficult, since enemy dots and movements are faster.
The change of the background picture also increases the difficulty.
You have three lives but due to state of being still in development, it gets refreshed if you manage to reach the second stage.
If you defeat the five enemies on the second stage, you have succeeded.

#####State
It is still in developing state, so some features are instable:
stepping up to stage 2 does not always work;
some dots disappear even though they hit nothing;
after beating the game, there should be a "Clear" announcement
