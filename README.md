####<br>There are two stages, the first one is easy, for getting used to the controls.<br>
You get to the second level when you defeat all enemies.<br>
The second one is more difficult, since the reappeared enemies shoot and move faster.<br>
The change of the background picture also increases the difficulty.<br>
